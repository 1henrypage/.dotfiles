## One-Line Install (Fresh System)

This setup supports **completely fresh machines** with nothing installed except `curl`.

### Run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1henrypage/.dotfiles/main/RUNME.sh | bash
```

## Requirements
This Dotfiles only supports git via SSH. Ensure that you have a SSH key configured in github.
